# Bank Customers Churn Prediction

## Project objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models for bank customer churn.

## Tasks
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Perform an in-depth analysis of customer churn data, including identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data.
- Feature Engineering: Determine the presence and influence of correlation data;
- Model Selection and Training: Train predictive models for customer churn prediction;
- Model Optimization: Optimize the selected models to improve their performance, including fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring different feature selection techniques.

## Conclusion

The final predictive model for bank churn is based on advanced machine learning techniques, such as LGBMClassifier. The model achieves the result of recall on test data: 80%.
The Deep Learning model is less efficient at classification and requires more computing resources.
